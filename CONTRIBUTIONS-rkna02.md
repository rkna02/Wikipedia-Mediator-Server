Task 2 implementation and debugging. Abstract function, Representation invariant, checkRep method for all classes 
Fixed variable names and modified datatypes to be thread safe.
Worked with simon throught entire project span.

Notes: Our third partner notified us that he is sick and has not been in contact with us since last week,
       So Simon and I did the entire project by ourselves and tried our best to cover his part. 
       However, we could not finish it on time due to the time constraints, just wanted to explain our situation with you,
       and by any chance, if we can be graded a bit less strictly :(
       Thank you very much for your consideration!
